INJECTING WITHOUT .inject
=========================

As part of our week 4 Friday Challenge at Makers Academy, we're asked to create the inject method without using .inject or .reduce. 

This helped a lot with my understand of Ruby methods. Attempt 1 allowed me to add using this method, then I ammended to include muliplication, division and subtraction.
